            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The Sweet Spot was developed by two aspiring second year Students at Vanier College in the Computer Science Program. Sereen Saaida and Valeriya Gergelyuk have collectively
                came up with the idea to mix their own personal aesthetic preferences and their love for dessert into a personalized website of their page.
